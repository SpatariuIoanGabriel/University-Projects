1.Compute the control digit of an integer by summing up its digits, then summing up the digits of the sum, so on, until a sum of only one digit is obtained.
5.Determine the value of the element at index k in the array 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4,... without reading or effectively creating the array.
9.Print all numbers with maximum 2 digits of form xy with the property that the last digit of (xy)^2 is y.
13.Read a natural number n. Form another number from its digits found at odd positions (from left to right).
17.A number n is special if there is a natural number m such that n=m+S(m) where S(m) is the sum of digits of m. Verify if a given number is special.
